  <h1>Cygnet Applications</h1>
  <p>This describes how to build applications in the Cygnet framework, in xml. A lot of common conventions are explained. Other dialog boxes, and pop ups get put into separate files, and will be dealt with later on.</p>
  <p>The root element for each xml file is program, and the xml is validated via a public DTD. Each file starts with a meta information section, then the formats available to the program, then the layout of the application. The file contains details of who made the program, and the layout including menus, menu items, icons, large icons (with pictures and text on them) and links to  any dialogs that need to pop up.</p>
  <p>Commands are already contained within the Cygnet API, and are documented. These are for common things, such as data validation, opening and saving in various formats and printing. Plugins are written by the application creator or by Paradise Software, and implement extra functionality outside of the core API. Plugins are written in Python 3.3. </p><p>The meta information part has author information, and a description of the program. More than one author may be listed. The security section is for linking a md5 hash or key/certificate to the program. That is useful for checking for authencity and whether the program has been tampered with. A md5 hash is created by typing <code>$ md5sum app_name.xml > hash_name.md5</code><br /> at the Linux command line. The program is checked against the md5 hash by typing: <code>$ md5sum -c hash_name.md5</code></p>

  <h2>File Formats</h2>
  <p>To enable a file format, you put the corresponding read/write format commands into the formats node of the xml. This calls the correct pieces of the API for reading and writing files. Some take mandatory options. See the table below.</p>
  <table id="file_formats">

   <h2>Layout Order</h2>
   <p>The layout has various parts that need to be in a certain order. Each application has a menu bar under a title bar displaying the name of the program, a common bar for commonly used functions and a file port and status bar. The file port contains the opened file, while the status bar is for updates that refresh often. </p><p>The tool pane is optional, and mobile layouts won't have one. In the tool pane you can have tool boxes, which look like field sets, full of icons. Below the tool pane, there is a help/error message area called the help box.</p>
   <h4>Layout Tag Order</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>menu_bar</li>
      <li>common_bar</li>
      <li>file_port</li>
      <li>status_bar</li>
      <li>tool_pane</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Menu Bar Creation</h3>
  <p>Each menu has an acckey which underlines one key to be used with ALT, or displays the keyboard shortcut. A separate events program registers the shortcut, enabling its use.<br />
  The menu's are laid out like below.</p>
  <img alt="The source to the format menu" src="images/ " />
  <h3>Common Bar</h3>
  <p>The common bar stores large icons, for common tasks or useful tasks, say looking up a word in a dictionary. </p>
  <img alt="A large icon with a picture on the left, and text to the right" src="images/ " />
  <p>These can also be controls with things like text fields within them.</p>
  <h3>Tool Pane</h3>
  <img alt="XML Code for a tool box within the tool pane" src="images/ " />
  <p>The tool pane holds 1 or more tool boxes, and the help box for information messages and small errors. The icons and controls are kept within a table, and look like this in the browser. The help box holds error, help and information messages, and tucks them out of the way. The more important errors will still pop up in a modal dialog. </p>
  <img alt="Tool box with icons and controls" src="images/ " />
  <h3>File Port</h3>
  <p>The file port contains a lexigraphic checker, to check for spelling and grammar mistakes. A context menu is also available for right clicks anywhere in that space.</p>
  <img alt="Code for the file port" src="images/ " />
  <h3>Status Bar</h3>
  <p>The settings menu on the left holds things like launchers for other applications, a menu for changing the theme and language changes for instance. The status bar holds small frequently updating programs, such as a word count. These provide text only output so as not to be so distracting.</p>
