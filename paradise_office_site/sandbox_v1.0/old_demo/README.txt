For Potential Employers:

To have a look round:
1. Make sure you have a recent browser with Javascript turned on.

2. If you want to look at the code, I suggest Notepad++ if you're using Windows as it makes the code easier to see and makes different parts look different colours.

3. To look at the site in a browser, right click 'complex_app_skel.html' and select your web browser of choice.

4. Feel free to resize the browser, or make it fullscreen and the application should fill the available space.
