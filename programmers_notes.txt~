- Use PHP add slashes and trim on all input fields, text areas etc.

For the Cygnet files: 
The field_box tag fills the dialog boxes from left to right. Percentages may be used for the height and width, in order to fit more than one field_box into a tab or dialog. So, with the format_pages dialog, on the second tab: they should render as thus

The larger one on the left is the page orientation box, the second largest is the margins, and the smallest one is the print preview options.

Also, I want large_icons to be set so that only one can be active at the same time, like radio buttons.

Radio and check boxes always appear with the clickable area on the left.

In dialog xml files, controls don't have a spans attribute in icons, only in char lengths for text_fields. width and height are determined by the icon picture dimensions.

Dialog boxes - non-modal : close button top right corner. Non resizeable.
              Modal: OK and cancel buttons, resizeable by program event, but not by the user.
              quick_menu : A hide button on the top edge with arrows. No bloody rounded corners on everything.
              confirm : A small diddy dialog box, that flashes in animated mode, or has a red border round it.

 A Python xml library for reading,writing, validating, and moving nodes in the dom around is required, but not installed on either system currently.

Spell check idea: parse the sentence then produce nearest matches - computer is reading for context.
