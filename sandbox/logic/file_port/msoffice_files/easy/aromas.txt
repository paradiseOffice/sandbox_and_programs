Product Story
Snow Fairy refuses to be pigeonholed. All sorts of people fall for her charms. We never fail to be amazed at the wide array of people who seem to love this pink confection. We have photos and letters from you, telling us your little girl likes it, it’s your gran and granddad’s favourite, your brother pinches it, etc,etc. We were even once sent a photo of a bunch of soldiers using it in the barracks showers!
So don’t write Snow Fairy off as pink and girly. It smells of candy floss and pear drops transports all of us back to days of standing in the sweet shop with our pocket money clasped in our fist, trying to decide what to buy.
Grab her and take her into a shower near you – you may have found a friend for life.
