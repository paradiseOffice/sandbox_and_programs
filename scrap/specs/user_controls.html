    Saving mantissa: int mantissa = 201;
    Saving decimal: int (long) dec = 23416789;
    <br />Save the whole number as an array e.g. number[mantissa,dec,exp]. </p>
  <h2>Spin Box</h2>
  <p>A small box with either a whole or float number that can go up or down. The user specfies by what step, and the lower and higher thresholds. </p>
  <h2>Text Field</h2>
